User Registration and Validation Website
📘 Overview

The User Registration and Validation Website is a secure and user-friendly web application that allows users to register, log in, and validate their credentials. It ensures secure data handling, strong password validation, and email-based authentication, making it ideal for systems that require verified user access.

🚀 Features

🔐 User Registration: Create new accounts with email, username, and password.

✅ Input Validation: Real-time form validation for email, password strength, and required fields.

✉️ Email Verification: Users must verify their email before account activation.

🔑 Login & Logout: Secure session handling using tokens or cookies.

🔁 Password Reset: Option to reset forgotten passwords via email.

👨‍💻 Admin Panel (Optional): Manage registered users and validation logs.

🔒 Security: Protection against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.

🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a client–server architecture:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React.js / Angular)
Backend: Node.js / Express.js (or Python Flask / PHP)
Database: MySQL / MongoDB
Security: JWT Authentication, bcrypt password hashing

🔄 Data Flow:

User fills out registration form → frontend validates inputs.

Data sent to backend via secure API.

Server validates and stores user data in the database.

Email verification link is sent to the user.

Upon clicking the link, account is activated.

User can then log in securely.

💡 Modules
1. Registration Module

Accepts username, email, and password.

Performs client-side and server-side validation.

Sends verification email after registration.

2. Login Module

Authenticates user credentials.

Generates a secure token/session.

Redirects to the user dashboard.

3. Validation Module

Validates email addresses through verification links.

Checks password strength and data integrity.

4. Admin Module (Optional)

Displays user list.

Tracks registration and login attempts.

Manages blocked or inactive accounts.

🎨 UI/UX Design

Simple and responsive design using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS.

Mobile-first approach.

Real-time form validation feedback (e.g., green ticks, red error messages).

Minimalist and modern color palette.
