User Registration and Validation

This project provides a simple user registration and validation system.
It allows users to create accounts securely with proper input validation.
User data is stored in a database after successful registration.
Validation checks include email format, password strength, and unique username.
Passwords are hashed using a secure hashing algorithm before storage.
The system prevents duplicate email or username registration.
Frontend form includes fields for name, email, and password.
Error messages are shown for invalid or missing inputs.
Users receive confirmation upon successful registration.
Backend APIs handle data submission and validation.
Input sanitization prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks.
Environment variables store sensitive configuration data.
Includes routes for user signup and validation endpoints.
Easily extendable for login, authentication, and user management.
Run the project using npm start or your preferred environment setup.
